# SSE2017_NuffieldNodeServer
This is the Github repository for SSE2017 Nuffield team's NodeJS server.

If you want to try to deploy this NodeJS server locally, you can try this:
//Before everything, make sure you have Node JS installed.

$npm install
$npm start

If success, the console should log a message said "Server running at http://localhost:3000".

Currently you can try the link http://nuffieldnodeserver.azurewebsites.net/query, which is a Server we deployed on Azure. If you request it via a post method rather than get, you will see a different output.
